Modern Web Development 2013 - Presenation
=========================================

This repository contains the code I used and wrote during my live demo at LIACS on 13 December 2013.

We developed at a simple application in 4 stages:

1. HTML + 'Vanilla' Javascript
2. + JQuery
3. + (S)CSS + AngularJS
4. + Twitter Bootstrap + More (S)CSS

A lot, unfortunately, could not be covered in 90 minutes. I was hoping to also write a small Node.js server with MongoDB database, but that turned out to be overly ambitious.


Useful Links
------------

Here are some of the links that I mentioned during the presentation, plus some extras that I think will be useful. In general, if you want to learn to use some technology `x`, search Youtube for `x tutorial` and look for one with many views and positive votes. There are some excellent vids out there:
