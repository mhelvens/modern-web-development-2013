Modern Web Development 2013
===========================

This is the github repository of a presentation and live demo I gave at LIACS, Leiden University in December 2013. This repository contains the code I used and wrote during the live demo.

We developed at a simple application in 4 stages:

1. HTML + 'Vanilla' Javascript
2. + JQuery
3. + (S)CSS + AngularJS
4. + Twitter Bootstrap + More (S)CSS

A lot, unfortunately, could not be covered in 90 minutes. I was hoping to also write a small Node.js server with MongoDB database, but that turned out to be overly ambitious.


Useful Links
------------

Here are some of the links that I mentioned during the presentation, plus some extras that I think will be useful. In general, if you want to learn to use some technology `x`, search Youtube for `x tutorial` and look for one with many views and positive votes. There are some excellent vids out there:

- [My Blogpost](http://www.mhelvens.net/personal/blog/web-app-development-choices) ([comments here](https://plus.google.com/116129313585072004834/posts/X31hP9AupUz) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/mhelvens/posts/602381493153264)); it contains links to all the official websites of the web-technologies I mentioned.
- [Javascript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742), by Douglas Crockford: an excellent introduction to Javascript as it is meant to be used.

    * The idea [won first prize](http://enschede.startupweekend.org/2013/03/18/moving-story-wins-startup-weekend-enschede-2013/) at Startup Weekend Enschede 2013.
    * I gave an interview about it for an article in [AR[t]](http://issuu.com/arlab/docs/art4_issuu/62).
